## Multiple Linear Regression 
- Linear regression methods
- Apply linear regression to solve specific business problems
- Evaluate how businesses tell stories with data

## Time Series 
### Preparing & Exploring Time Series Data 
- Accumulate and index data for time series analysis
- Plot a time series
- Impute missing values for a time series
### Understanding Autocorrelation & Stationarity 
- Define the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions
- Define stationarity
- Identify non-stationary series based on the properties of the series
- Use Python to compute and plot the ACF and PACF, and to carry out the augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity
### ARIMA Models 
- Define Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) models
- Use the ACF and PACF to identify the order of AR models and MA models
- Use the ACF and PACF to identify the order of full ARIMA models
- Use Python to implement the methods for specific time series
